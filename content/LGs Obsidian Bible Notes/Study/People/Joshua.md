> **15**)  If it is evil in your sight to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served which were beyond the River or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my house, we will serve Yahweh." 



# Observations

# Interesting 


His name was once Hoshea before it was changed to Joshua by [[Moses]]
[[Books/Bibles/The Bible (LSB)/04 - Numbers/Num 13#16|Num 13.16]] 
**16**)  These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua. </mark>

It is unclear as to why the change was made
Hoshea - desire for salvation
Joshua - the Lord is salvation
