His name was once Hoshea before it was changed to Joshua by [[Moses]]
[[Books/Bibles/The Bible (LSB)/04 - Numbers/Num 13#16|Num 13.16]] 
**16**)  These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua. </mark>

It is unclear as to why the change was made
Hoshea - desire for salvation
Joshua - the Lord is salvation
