**15**)  Then Jehoiada became old and full of days, and he died; he was 130 years old at his death. 
**16**)  They buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done what is good in Israel and to God and His house. 
**17**)  But after the death of Jehoiada the officials of Judah came and bowed down to the king, and the king listened to them. 
**18**)  And they forsook the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and served the Asherim and the idols; so wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their guilt.
