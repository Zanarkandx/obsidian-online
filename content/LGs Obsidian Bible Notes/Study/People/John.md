**1**)  Now on the first _day_ of the week, Mary Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it *was still dark, and *saw the stone _already_ taken away from the tomb. 
**2**)  So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, "They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him." 
**3**)  So Peter and the other disciple went forth, and they were going to the tomb. 
**4**)  And the two were running together; and the other disciple ran ahead faster than Peter and came to the tomb first; 
**5**)  and stooping and looking in, he *saw the linen wrappings lying _there_; but he did not go in. 
**6**)  And so Simon Peter also *came, following him, and entered the tomb; and he *saw the linen wrappings lying there, 
**7**)  and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen wrappings, but folded up in a place by itself. 
**8**)  So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb then also entered, and he saw and believed. 
**9**)  For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. 
**10**)  So the disciples went away again to where they were staying.Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
