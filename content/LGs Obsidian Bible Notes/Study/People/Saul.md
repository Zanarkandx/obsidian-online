**10**)  Now it happened on the next day that an evil spirit from God came mightily upon Saul, and he raved in the midst of the house. Now David was playing _the harp_ with his hand, as usual; and a spear _was_ in Saul's hand. 
**11**)  Then Saul hurled the spear for he thought, <mark style="background: #833821A6;">"I will pin David to the wall."</mark> But David escaped from his presence twice. 
**12**)  And Saul was afraid of David, for Yahweh was with him but had turned away from Saul.

**20**)  And Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David. So they told Saul, and the thing was right in his eyes. 
**21**)  And Saul said, "I will give her to him that she may become a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him." Therefore Saul said to David, "For a second time you may be my son-in-law today."
